To run the J-- reference compiler:

% cd reference
% ./main -h				(for options)

% ./main -ptokenize testfile		(for scanner output)

The scanner output is a list of tokens.  Each token is a triple
(token type as string, line number as integer, token lexeme as string).
Note that the EOF is implicit in the list ending, so there's no
explicit EOF token being produced here.
