The code gen example is not written to generate .wat files.
It exists only to provide you with ideas on how you can structure your
cgen implementation and what kind of steps you need to take
to generate .wat code for different statements in J--

The given files only serve to give you an understanding of how
code generation works by doing so in a different language.
You must use this understanding to generate code in .wat format.

Additionally, if you have used the EX compiler as a 
base for your previous milestones, this continues that structure
and helps provide ideas as to how you can structure your cgen
implementation to fit with how you did your previous milestones.
